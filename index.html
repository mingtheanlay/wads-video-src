        A product of the Cold War, it was originally designed to penetrate
        Soviet air defenses and carry both conventional and nuclear weapons. But
        shortly after its first flight, over 30 years ago in 1989, the fall of
        the Berlin Wall ended the Cold War and no B-2 has ever flown inside
        Russian airspace.

          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, it has seen its fair share of combat. The first B-2
            was delivered in 1993 to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where
            the fleet is based and still operates, and its first operational use
            was during the 1999 Kosovo War. One of the most sophisticated flying
            machines in existence, the B-2 can reach a target anywhere in the
            world and return to base, refueling in mid-air. No B-2 has ever been
            lost in combat. "It is really one of a kind, completely unlike any
            other plane ever designed," Rebecca Grant, a B-2 and aerospace
            expert who has flown in the classified plane, said in a phone
            interview. "Seen from the cockpit, the flying wing is so
            distinctive. It is very special -- more of a sentient being than
            just a regular airplane. Maybe that's why all of the B-2s are
            rumored to have unique personalities and they're often referred to
            as she.

          <h4>Early 'flying wings'</h4>
          <p>
            The idea of designing a plane as a flying wing -- without a definite
            fuselage, a tail and other protuberances -- is an early one in
            aviation, surfacing before World War I in Germany and the Soviet
            Union.
          </p>

              Towards the end of World War II, Nazi Germany built and tested the
              Horten Ho 229, a futuristic flying wing aircraft with rudimentary
              stealth features, to which the B-2 bears a striking resemblance.

          </aside>
          <p>
            <mark>In the United States, </mark>this type of design was pioneered by aircraft
            designer and industrialist Jack Northrop, whose first flying wing
            prototypes -- in small scale and powered by propeller engines --
            took to the skies in 1940. Northrop's work culminated in the YB-49,
            his first jet powered flying wing design, in 1947. Far ahead of its
            time, the project was held back by technical difficulties and
            quickly scrapped. However, the work done on the YB-49 was used to
            kickstart the B-2 program --- the company that makes it was founded
            by Northrop himself -- and although the planes are decades apart,
            they have many similarities, including the exact same wingspan.
